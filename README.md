# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game
This is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe Game developed using HTML, CSS, and JS. This is one of my first projects in JavaScript. the features that I added in this game are
* the boxes zoom a little when we hover them.
* The game will tell who is the winner after the completion of the game.
* You will get the message when the game is a Draw.
